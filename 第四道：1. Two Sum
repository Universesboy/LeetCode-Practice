第四道：1. Two Sum
  Solve method: hashmap
    class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
       nums_map ={} #val : index 

       for i, n in enumerate (nums):
        diff = target - n
        if diff in nums_map:
            return [nums_map[diff],i] # Return the indices of the elements that sum to target
        nums_map [n] = i # Store index of the current number
       return[] 
         
What I ‘ve learned:

What Does **Enumerate** Do in Python? Enumerate is a built-in function in python that **allows you to keep track of the number of iterations (loops) in a loop**.
